Hi! 
After years of working in IT, as a first line technical support person, I decided to change activities a bit and try my hand at programming.
 
I'm currently learning to be a developer and I'm looking for an internship! 
I decided to make my own website on GitHub, where I will publish the story of my journey into the world of development, as well as my projects.  

If you want to know more about me, I invite you to check out the about me section of this site.  

Join!
